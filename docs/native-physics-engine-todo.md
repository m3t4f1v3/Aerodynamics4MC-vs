# Native Physics Engine Todo

This is the working backlog for the Fabric mod runtime, ordered by practical impact rather than abstract completeness.

## Current Baseline

The following are already present in code:

- `L0` dynamic background met grid
- `L1` mesoscale grid with humidity and severe-weather diagnostics
- one-way nested `L1 -> L2` boundary fields
- `WorldScaleDriver`
- `CycloneCell`
- `ConvectiveCluster`
- `TornadoVortex`
- `L0/L1` dump pipeline
- client `AeroVisualizer` wind-trail/streamline overlay

The main missing areas are usability, observability, and the foliage/shaderpack integration that was lost from the working tree.

There is also a strategic change:

- stitched runtime `L2` should no longer be treated as the main player-facing CFD showcase
- the next local-air push should center on an on-demand local `L2` patch near the player
- `L1` should remain the default background air field outside active local solves
- see `docs/on-demand-l2-prefetch-design.md`
- for the longer-term engine-grade `L2` direction, see `docs/native-authoritative-l2-runtime-design.md`

## P0: Restore Missing Tooling

These are required to get back to the last useful working state.

- restore `docs/` design notes
- restore `eval_background_snapshot.py`
- restore `eval_mesoscale_snapshot.py`
- restore foliage real-wind client path
- restore shaderpack compatibility scaffolding

Status:

- `eval_background_snapshot.py`: restored
- `eval_mesoscale_snapshot.py`: restored
- `docs/`: restored
- foliage/shaderpack path: still missing

## P1: Runtime Observability

These make the system maintainable.

- keep `/aero dumpdata` stable
- keep dump JSON schemas documented
- add explicit versioning if snapshot schema changes again
- add clearer severe-weather diagnostics if tornado tuning resumes
- improve `/aero status` only when it helps operations, not as a vanity dashboard

## P2: Weather Stack

### Already landed

- world-scale persistent weather driver
- cyclone cells
- convective clusters
- tornado generation logic
- tornado forcing into `L1`
- tornado descriptor staging toward `L2`

### Still open

- validate `TornadoVortex -> L2` in practice
- decide whether tornado rarity is final behavior or just a conservative default
- cloud/condensation proxy
- cloud rendering

## P3: Gameplay Integration

These are still largely not done.

### Player/environment feedback

- player probe exposed to gameplay
- thermal feedback
- wind feedback
- sound/particle feedback

### Entity integration

- entity sample collection
- lightweight entity aerodynamics coupling
- gameplay-safe interaction rules

### Block/environment integration

- fire/smoke/rain directional response
- foliage real-wind motion
- duct/fan explanation and debugging polish
- chimney / ventilation airflow mechanics

## P3.5: On-Demand Local L2

This is now the main local-air direction.

Target:

- one on-demand local patch
- `64 blocks -> 128^3`
- six-face background boundary
- sponge shell
- native precompute of `5` local frames
- `int16` quantized direct-buffer publication to Java
- local consumers only

Primary goals:

- make air feel continuous near the player
- make geometry-shaped wakes and recirculation legible
- drive smoke / steam / fire and building airflow mechanics

First implementation priorities:

- sampler around the player
- handwritten discriminator
- fixed-size local patch activation state machine
- six-face boundary sampling from the existing weather stack
- native precompute ring buffer
- Java-side interpolation and consumption
- smoke/fire/chimney consumers

## P4: Client Visualization

Current client state:

- `AeroVisualizer` exists
- wind-trail streamline path exists
- debug overlay exists

Missing from the later working tree:

- `FoliageWindField`
- `FoliageWindRenderer`
- `FoliageWindReactivity`
- `ShaderpackCompatManager`
- client mixin/config scaffolding for foliage path
- `foliage_terrain` shaders
- BSL/Iris patch tools

This is the largest missing functional chunk outside the weather runtime itself.

Important scope note:

- do not continue investing in stitched `L2` CFD-style visualization as the primary proof path
- use client visualization mainly to support readable local-air gameplay and focused inspection

## P5: Shaderpack Compatibility

Planned direction:

- Iris-first
- BSL as first supported base pack
- runtime wind contract owned by the mod
- pack-side support owned by shaderpacks or explicit optional integrations
- keep built-in foliage path as fallback/debug path

Developer tooling that may exist for this line:

- `inspect_shaderpack.py`
- `patch_bsl_shaderpack.py`
- `shaderpack-compat/bsl/*`

Those tools are useful for development and validation, but they should not define the shipping product model.
- `docs/shaderpack-wind-compat-design.md`

## P6: Guardrails

When adding new systems:

- no silent schema drift in dump JSON
- no opaque runtime magic without diagnostics
- no large client rendering branch without a fallback path
- no new weather object without persistence and snapshot visibility

## Suggested Recovery Order

1. Finish restoring docs
2. Restore foliage real-wind client path
3. Restore shaderpack/BSL compatibility scaffold
4. Re-test `/aero dumpdata` end-to-end
5. Resume gameplay integration only after observability is back in place
